Pre-Lab Questions:

1a. N /2 is the size of the largest padded image needed to handle padding
with any kernel size.

1b.(N/2, N/2)

1c. (256 + N /2, 256 + N /2)

2. 

Raw Values              Normalized Values
0.7788 0.8825 0.7788       0.1019 0.1154 0.1019
0.8825 1.0000 0.8825       0.1154 0.1308 0.1154
0.7788 0.8825 0.7788       0.1019 0.1154 0.1019

The higher the value the brighter the image, and sine the raw values are
higher than the normalized values if we were to use this then we would have
a brighter image.

Experimentation:

1. Both N and sigma change the bluriness of the photo. As N and sigma 
increase then the picture becomes progressively more blury. As N and sigma
decrease the picture is less blury. 

2. Sobel filter detects any significant changes in color. Creates an image
emphasizing the edges.

3. You cannot recover the same image because the inverse value is being 
added onto the input.

4. It increases by n^2.
